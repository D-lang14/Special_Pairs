# Question Solved
Imagine you're exploring a sequence of numbers up to a certain limit. Within this sequence, you're on the lookout for pairs of special numbers. These pairs have a unique quality - when you add them together, you get a specific target sum, and both numbers are prime. Can you provide a sorted list of these special pairs, following the given criteria? 

## Example 1: 
#### Input: 
n = 18 
#### Output: 
[[5,13], [7,11]] 

## Example 2: 
#### Input: 
n = 13 
#### Output: 
[[2,11]]

## Explanation:
#### Step 1: Identify Prime Numbers
Identify all prime numbers up to the given limit.
#### Step 2: Find Special Pairs
For each pair of prime numbers, check if their sum equals the target sum and if so, add them to the list of special pairs.
#### Step 3: Sort Special Pairs
Sort the list of special pairs in ascending order.
